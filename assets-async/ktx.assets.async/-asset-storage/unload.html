<p>Removes asset loaded with the given <a href="unload.html#ktx.assets.async.AssetStorage$unload(kotlin.String)/path">path</a> and <a href="unload.html#T">T</a> type and all of its dependencies.
Does nothing if asset was not loaded in the first place.
Will not dispose of the asset if it still is referenced by any other assets.
Any removed assets that implement <a href="#">Disposable</a> will be disposed.</p>
<p>Note: only assets that were explicitly scheduled for loading with <a href="load.html">load</a>, <a href="load-async.html">loadAsync</a> or
<a href="load-sync.html">loadSync</a>, or manually added to storage with <a href="add.html">add</a> should be unloaded.
Dependencies of assets will be removed automatically along with the original assets
that caused them to load in the first place.</p>
<p>Assets scheduled for loading multiple times must be explicitly unloaded multiple times -
until the asset is unloaded as many times as it was referenced, it is assumed that it is
still used. Manually unloading dependencies of other assets (that were not scheduled
for loading explicitly) might lead to unexpected runtime exceptions.</p>
<p>Will log all exceptions related to unloading of the assets. Silence the <a href="logger.html">logger</a>
to avoid exception logging.</p>
<p>Returns <code>true</code> if the asset was present in the <a href="index.html">AssetStorage</a>. Note that if the asset
is still referenced (i.e. <a href="load.html">load</a> was called multiple times or the asset is a dependency
of an asset that is still loaded), the asset will not be disposed of and will remain
in the storage even if <code>true</code> is returned.</p>
